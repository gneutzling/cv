I have been working with frontend development for the last 10 years, focused in build great products for different type of customers. I am focused in the world of Javascript, including ReactJS and always looking for new tools, modules and ways to improve my skills and sharing knowledge with the whole team.

In addition I believe that we can have better place to work when we have self organizing teams.
